# 🪞 GEN-Z Smart Mirror (AI + IoT Based Interactive Mirror)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **GEN-Z Smart Mirror** is an intelligent and interactive smart mirror that integrates  
**Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, and Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies  
to enhance daily personal care and smart living.

Unlike traditional mirrors, this system provides **real-time environmental monitoring**,  
**face analysis**, **emotion detection**, **gesture-based interaction**, and  
**personalized grooming recommendations**.
